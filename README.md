Dicom (Digital Imaging in Medicine) is the bread and butter of medical image datasets, storage and transfer. 
This is the future home of the Pydicom documentation. If you are a Python developer looking to get started with Dicom and Python, 
this will be the place to learn and contribute! For now, here are some helpful links, and general plan for some of the code bases in the organization. If you want to come and chat, find our community on Gitter, or post an issue on one of our repos.
